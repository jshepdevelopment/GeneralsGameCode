Generals compiling with VS 2022
Make sure MFC is installed
you need to set your environment variables for PATH to add Generals\Code\Tools\NVASM
You also need a copy of the 3DS Max 4.x SDK, to be placed in Code\Libraries\max4sdk. This is available from `maxsdk.zip` on the 3DS Max CD.

The game can now load all loose files for modding(you will need to package your game to a .big file to ship your mod), download a big extractor extract all the .big files to the game folder(patch* ones last),
then you can delete the big files.
